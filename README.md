## Proxy-auto-discovery for command line applications (pac4cli)

![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/tkluck/pac4cli.svg)

### Introduction

On many corporate networks, applications need
[proxy-auto-discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Proxy_Auto-Discovery_Protocol)
to know whether a certain URL is accessed either directly or through a web
proxy. Browsers can typically handle this, but many command line applications
(git, npm, apt, curl) rely on environment variable to hard-code a proxy
regardless of the destination URL.

This little daemon enables these applications for auto-discovery by:

- setting the `http_proxy` variable (and friends) to http://localhost:3128
- providing a simple proxy at that port that does proxy-auto-discovery and
  connects accordingly.

System dependencies:
- systemd
- NetworkManager

Python library dependencies from PyPI can be installed through:

    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### Installation instructions

#### Ubuntu

The latest builds are available through a PPA:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tkluck/pac4cli
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install pac4cli

You'll need to restart your shell for the new environment variables to take effect.

This will install `pac4cli` for most of your command line tools. However, we
don't ship configuration for Apt. If you want to use `pac4cli` for software
updates, you'll need to run the following:

    sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99pac4cli <<CONFIG
    Acquire::http::proxy "http://localhost:3128/";
    Acquire::https::proxy "http://localhost:3128/";
    # The following are needed to work around limitations
    # in pac4cli's support of http features:
    Acquire::http::No-Cache true;
    Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth 0;
    CONFIG

The reason why this is not included in the Ubuntu package is that if pac4cli ever
breaks, we could not ship an update to unbreak it.

#### Archlinux

This package is available in AUR.

#### Other (Mac, other linuxes)

The dependencies can be installed through

    brew install coreutils # for `realpath` in Makefile
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Then, use

    make install

**Just `python setup.py install` is not sufficient.** That will only install
the pac4cli module, but not the binary or the configuration files.
